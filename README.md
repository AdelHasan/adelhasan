# Adel Hasan : Full-Stack Web Developer

Thanks for checking out my GitHub!

I'm a software engineer from Houston and a graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program, where I learned full-stack web development, focused primarily on JavaScript libraries for building and styling responsive front ends, and non-relational backends built with Mongoose. 

As a software engineer in the early stages of my career I certainly intend to continue to sharpen the skills I have learned while continuing to expand my skillset into new languages, frameworks and libraries. I'm actively job seeking for development roles, and if you're interested in connecting or collaborating you can find me on [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adelhasan/), or check out my [portfolio](https://adelhasan.github.io/portfoliov2/) to learn more about me and my work.
